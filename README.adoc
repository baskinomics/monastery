This repository currently contains shell scripts to bootstrap my development environment in a fresh Ubuntu installation.

== Roadmap

This will initially start as a collection of bash scripts as I come across the various tasks (as I am once again repeating this process currently). Once these tasks have been identified and automated via bash I will begin the migration to Ansible.
