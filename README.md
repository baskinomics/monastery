# Monastery

This repository currently contains shell scripts to bootstrap my development environment in a fresh Ubuntu installation.

## Roadmap

This will initially start as a collection of bash scripts as I come across the various tasks (as I am once again repeating this process currently). Once these tasks have been identified and automated via bash I will begin the migration to Ansible.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:baskinomics/monastery.git
$ cd monastery/bash
$ sudo bash getting-started.sh
```

## Notes

I have decided to include markdown versions of various collections of notes on a variety of relevant subject matter in this repository. These notes may serve as the basis for future shell scripts or blog entries, but also as a resource for myself future and present.

These documents can be found under the `notes/` directory.
